    int NumberOne = 8;
    int NumberTwo = 10; // Those two numbers will need to be added to each other.
    
    int total = NumberOne + NumberTwo; 
    /*I have created a new interger that is called total
    The answer is NumberOne +NumberTwo making the interger total of 18. 
    Lets see if it correct.*/
    cout << ("Number one: ")<< NumberOne << endl;
    cout << ("Number two: ") << NumberTwo << endl;
    cout << ("Total: ") << total << endl;    
}



//Update - Yes it is correct the answer is 18.
//So we can add two intergers, sutract, mulitply and divde two number together.
/*
int total = Num1 * Num2; --- This is to multiply two numbers.
int total = Num1 / Num2; -- This is used to devide two numbers.
int total = Num2 - Num1; --- This is used to sutract numbers/
To add look at the example above. :)
