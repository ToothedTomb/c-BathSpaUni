/*
Part two:
Suppose the room has doors and windows that donâ€™t need painting. Ask the user to enter the number of doors and number of windows in the room, and adjust the total square feet to be painted accordingly. Assume that each door is 20 square feet and each window is 15 square feet.

Part 2 can be added to the same project file as part 1  */
