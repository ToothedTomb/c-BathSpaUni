# Utility App - Assignment 2

## The Task

Your task is to create a Vending Machine program using the C++ programming language.

The Vending Machine must have the following features as a minimum requirement:

* A menu of drinks and snacks presented via the console. The number and range of items is up to you.
* A set of codes that the user can input to select a particular drink or snack.
* A way of capturing the user’s inputted code.
* A way of managing money. The user should be able to input any amount of money and have the correct change returned.
* A message that tells the user that a particular drink or snack has been dispensed.
* A message that tells the user how much change they have received.
* Comments in the code to explain key operations.

You may wish to add additional features to your Vending Machine to achieve higher marks. Below is an indication of some of these features, however you may wish to come up with your own:

* A method of categorising the menu items in the vending machine to improve the user experience (e.g. ‘Chocolate’ or ‘Hot Drinks’).
* A way of allowing users to buy additional items.
* Appropriate error checking to validate inputs and ensure the user has enough credit
* An intelligence system for suggesting purchases. For example, if you buy a coffee, the vending machine may suggest that you buy biscuits.
* The use of functions to improve the structure of your program.
* A stock system meaning the machine may run out of products

## Deliverables

The deliverables for the Utility App are as follows:

### The Application

The C++ code (e.g. ```main.cpp``` file) and any supplementary assets required to run your vending machine. This should be submitted as a project saved to this folder and pushed to GitHub before the deadline.

### The Development Document

Your Vending Machine C++ program must be accompanied by a Development Document of 1000 words. 

Please include the following elements (note the suggested word counts):

* **Specification:** A short explanation of what you have been asked to build and a list of features that your vending machine includes. This section should also include a link to your GitHub repository. (100 words)
* **System Flowchart:** A visual depiction of the logical operation of your Vending Machine. This should be accompanied by a short explanation (50 words).
* **Technical Description & Walkthrough:** In this section you should provide a link to a video which includes a walkthrough of your program running as well as a technical breakdown of your code. This technical breakdown should explain how the key features of your program have been implemented via code. The video technical description & walkthrough contributes to the overall word count a approx. 100 words per minute. The anticipated length of the video should be between 5 - 8 minutes, anything longer than 10minutes will not be reviewed and may result in a mark penalty. (500 - 800 words)
* **Critical Reflection:** This should describe what aspects of your Vending Machine you find compelling, what could be improved, and what programming skills you need to learn to make such improvements. (250 words)
* **Appendix:** A copy of your code should be included in an appendix at the end of your documentation. Not included in word count)

Your development document should be uploaded to the Turnitin link located in the assessment folder on Minerva.
