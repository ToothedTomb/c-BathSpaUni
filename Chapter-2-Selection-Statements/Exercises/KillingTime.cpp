/*
You are killing time in the middle of Bath city centre, waiting for your friend who is always late. 
You receive a text telling you how late they are going to be.

Write a program that follows the below rules:

    Scenario 1: Your friend is going to be another 15 minutes or more Result: If you have more 
    than 3 pounds in change, go buy a coffee, otherwise go for a walk around the town

 
    Scenario 2: Your friend is going to with you in less than 15 minutes
    Result: Sit in the park and wait (probably grumbling).

You will need to use a nested IF-ELSE statement to complete this task. 
Please print appropriate text to the console to describe the result of each scenario.
