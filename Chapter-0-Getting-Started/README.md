# Getting Started

## Installing an IDE

Class demonstrations are taught using Visual Studio. If using your own laptop in class you are welcome to use any IDE of your choice. For example if you are on Mac we’d recommend using XCode. To practice programming outside of class you should ensure you have an IDE installed on your home computer. If you are unsure of how to install an IDE contact your tutor for help.

If you are struggling to install a compiler online ones are available which allow you to run and save your code (so there’s no excuse for not coding outside of class).

You can find information on how to start a project in Visual Studio or Xcode in the guides provided on Minerva


## Practicing outside of class

Programming is a difficult skill to master and you will struggle to get to grips with it by coding in the classroom sessions alone. You need to practice coding between classes to ensure you do not get left behind. 4 - 5 hours (or more) of additional practice each week will make a world of difference to your code.


## Using GitHub

Throughout CodeLab we will be using GitHub to keep track of the code we create (you should be reading this on GitHub now!). You should save the solutions to the chapter exercises in your CodeLab GitHub repository. Your tutor will review the code you post on GitHub after each programming skills portfolio assessment submission and provide feedback to help you improve. Guides on using GitHub can be found on Minerva and if you have any questions let your tutor know.


## 1-2-1 Tutorials

If you are struggling with any of the concepts introduced in class and would like some additional programming help 1-2-1 tutorials are always available. You can find details on how to arrange tutorials on Minerva.
