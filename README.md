# CodeLab I
CodeLab I - CCO4000-20 Module Materials

## Module Overview

CodeLab I introduces you to the fundamentals of programming. You encounter the first principles of coding from computational thinking and logic through to key programming elements such as variables, conditionals, loops, arrays and functions.

We assume little to no prior experience of coding on entry. You learn programming from the ground up, working through coding challenges and creative briefs that help embed new techniques and best practice into your programming ‘toolkit’.

The covers the following topics

An introduction to the core concepts of programming. You build simple applications that support your understanding of the following topics:
* Algoritmic thinking & logic
* Version control tools
* Data types (int, float, double, boolean, char, string)
* Basic user interactivity
* Operators
* Conditional statements (if, if-else, switch)
* Control flow statements (while, do-while, for)
* Arrays
* Functions (passing in, returning out)
* File Handling
* Basics of OOP

## Repository Contents

### Chapters

These folders breakdown the fundamental programming techniques covered in the module into individual chapters. These chapters should be used in combination with weekly session materials provided on **Minerva** for full information on everything covered through the module. The chapters and content are ordered in line with the classroom content allowing you to follow along before putting what you’ve learned into practice with the exercises.

### Chapter Exercises

Each chapter includes exercises to help you put into practice the techniques taught in each chapter. Exercises under the heading **Assessment Exercises** are required for the programming skills portfolio assessment.

Further exercises are provided under the heading **Practice Exercises**. As the title suggests these are here for you to practice and develop your programming skills. Completing these exercises is encouraged, although they have **no impact** on the programming skills portfolio mark.

For each exercise you should create a _**new project**_ with the name of the exercise and save it to this exercises folder in your local repository. Once you have completed your solution you should make sure you commit and push the code to your remote repository on GitHub. You can commit and push as many changes to your solutions as you wish, only those pushed before the chapter deadlines will be marked for the Programming Skills Portfolio.


*Please note that when pushing changes back to Github only the code files will be uploaded, not the Visual Studio / Xcode project files. These have been intentionally ignored by a .gitignore file in the root of the repository to keep Github desktop interface and the GitHub repository clutter free. If you need to access a project on a different machine to the one where the project was originally generated, you may need to create a fresh project and copy in the code from the .cpp file, or create a project from existing code. Guides for doing this are provided in the guides folder.*

### Further Exercises

This folder contains additional exercises that should be used if you are looking for some tougher challenges beyond those included in the chapter exercises.

### Resources

Useful code snippets for common tasks in C++

### Utility App

This folder should be used to submit your vending machine program for the Utility App assignment. Please refer to the full assessment brief on Minerva for details.
